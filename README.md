mapbox-osx
==========

Unofficial OS X version of MapBox SDK.

This is a PARTIALLY functional version of the Route-Me/Mapbox framework. The basic viewing of maps works but there are
still bugs and unimplemented features that exist in the iOS version of the framework.

Requires Mac OS X 10.8.

Currently tested with "retina" resolution Mac display only.
